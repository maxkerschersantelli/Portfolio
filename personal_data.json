		"<p>It’s nice to meet you! My name’s Max and I’m an ambitious frontend developer with a focus in React development based in the Bay Area. Welcome to my portfolio, feel free to explore and tell me what you think. My life is all things web application development from building complex user interactions to creating large scalable applications. Mostly, I’m eager to create, problem solve, and challenge myself. </p><p>I’ve been doing web development for the past four years, and I’m currently looking for work so feel free to contact me at <a href='mailto:maxkerschersantelli@gmail.com' >maxkerschersantelli@gmail.com</a> or through my <a class='sc-gZMcBi EOUdn' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-kerscher-santelli-34573238'>LinkedIn</a> here. I’d love to talk UX design solutions, mastering coding solutions, you name it!</p><p> Side note: To build this site I used React with Redux, server side rendering, code splitting, and Flow (which I know is over-engineered for a site this size, but it was way too much fun to pass up).</p>",
